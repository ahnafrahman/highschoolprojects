In high school, I created a weighted average calculator to simplify the process of calculating overall grades. 
The calculator takes into account the four categories used by the TDSB to grade students: Knowledge, Thinking, Application, and Communication. 
Instead of manually calculating grades, students can input their marks and the calculator will do the rest.
